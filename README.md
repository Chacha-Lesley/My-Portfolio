Lesley Chacha’s Portfolio

Welcome to my creative portfolio! This site documents my journey from writer to budding developer, with a timeline, animated trackers, fun facts, and more—all built with pure HTML and CSS.

Features
1. Page and Layout Styling
- Global body and main container use a fixed, centered background image with full-viewport coverage for cohesive visual impact.
- The default font is set to the clean, sans-serif Trebuchet MS for readability.
- Flexbox and percentage widths ensure responsive layouts on various screen sizes.
2. Navigation Sidebar
- A fixed overlay navigation panel slides in/out from the right, with a translucent dark background and subtle shadow for focus.
- Navigation links are styled for clarity with smooth hover and focus states, including underline and color transitions.
- Responsive adjustments transform the sidebar to a horizontal top menu on smaller screens (<700px).
- Toggle button for opening and closing the nav includes a custom-styled animated hamburger icon.
3. Header and Text Effects
- A solid dark header with white centered text.
- A typewriter-style animated text effect with blinking cursor using CSS keyframe animations for engaging introduction text.
4. Profile Picture Styling
- Circular profile images with subtle shadows and white borders.
- Hover effects enlarge and rotate the image slightly for interactive feedback.
5. Sections and Content Blocks
- Content sections use whites and light pastel backgrounds with rounded corners and subtle shadows to create clear visual separation.
- Project highlights have colored borders for emphasis.
- Typography uses monospace fonts for headings, and clean, readable fonts for body text with appropriate spacing.
6. Footer
- The footer uses a dark background with centered, white text for consistent branding.
7. Buttons
- Rounded orange buttons with hover effects that change color and add slight rotation and scaling animations.
- Separate styles for different button types, e.g., download and contact buttons.
8. Interactive Mascot Emoji
- A fixed-position emoji mascot with smooth waving animation.
- On hover, the mascot scales up, rotates, and reveals a speech bubble with additional info.
9. Timeline Component
- A styled timeline with togglable details summaries, animated arrow icons, and pastel orange highlights.
- Responsive font sizes and padding adjustments for mobile devices.
10. Fun Facts Section
- Center-aligned with expressive headers in monospace.
- Facts presented in boxed sections with left border accents and subtle shadows for prominence.
11. Accessibility and Usability
