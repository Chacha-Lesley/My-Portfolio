    <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>Languages I wish to speak (in brackets and bugs):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> – My native tongue</li>
      <li><strong>HTML &amp; CSS</strong> – My bread and butter</li>
      <li><strong>Python</strong> – Fluent in logic and simplicity</li>
      <li><strong>PHP</strong> – For those old-school moments</li>
      <li><strong>SQL</strong> – When I need to talk data</li>
      <li><strong>C#</strong> – When Unity calls</li>
      <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> – JavaScript, but with a tie</li>
      <li><em>Bonus:</em> I’m also dangerously curious around Shell scripting and dabbling with Rust (just for fun, not for pain... yet).</li>

  <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2015:</strong> Blogged like my life depended on it</summary>
    <p>Launched my first blog with a free theme, a lot of opinions, and zero SEO knowledge. Felt like CNN.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2018:</strong> Got paid to write</summary>
    <p>Made actual money from writing. Immediately started calling myself a “content strategist” in my bio. Fake it? Nah. I earned it.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2019:</strong> Scriptwriting phase</summary>
    <p>Wrote a play that made three people laugh and one person cry. I decided that counted as “impact.”</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2020:</strong> Organized my chaos with Notion</summary>
    <p>Started treating my life like a startup — ideas on sticky notes, dreams in spreadsheets, reality... still loading.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2021:</strong> Discovered Canva by accident</summary>
    <p>Was trying to make a mood board. Ended up designing a fake poster. Genuinely believed I was a graphic designer for a week.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2023:</strong> Code curiosity kicks in</summary>
    <p>I typed “How hard is it to learn coding?” and fell into a rabbit hole. The internet said it’s doable. So I believed it.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2024 (Feb):</strong> Touched my first line of HTML</summary>
    <p>It was &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;. I screamed when it worked. Also screamed when it broke ten minutes later.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2024 (April):</strong> First button appeared on screen</summary>
    <p>It didn’t do anything, but it was there. On purpose. Felt like magic.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2025 (March):</strong> Tried JavaScript for the first time</summary>
    <p>It didn’t try me back. But we’re working on our relationship.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2025 (June):</strong> Joined a hackathon anyway</summary>
    <p>Do I know what I’m doing? Not really.<br>
      Am I doing it anyway? Absolutely.<br>
      Am I Googling every five minutes? Also yes.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>2025 (August 1):</strong> Building my first app (!!!)</summary>
    <p>Plot twist: the writer is now learning to build things that don’t live in paragraphs. I’m not a developer yet — but I’m a developer in progress.</p>
  </details>

<section id="about-me" class="section">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a storyteller at heart — the kind who usually crafts plot twists, not functions. But lately, I’ve swapped my pen for a text editor and discovered a brand new narrative: writing in code.
  </p>
  <p>
    I used to write stories; now, I wire up websites, explore design systems, and occasionally find myself dreaming in API endpoints. My toolkit is powered by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Restless curiosity</li>
    <li> Late-night “why-is-this-broken” marathons</li>
    <li> A love of tidy Figma files and the thrill of a perfectly-aligned div</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When I’m not buried in code, you’ll probably find me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sketching oddball ideas that might (or might not) become “the next big thing”</li>
    <li>Turning Google Docs into blueprints for new projects</li>
    <li>Pitching half-baked app concepts to my ever-patient friends</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Truth is, this is my very first deep dive into coding — and I’m completely hooked. Every line I write is a new sentence in a bigger story. And I can’t wait to see where this one goes next.
